# Guess the flag game


## Why I made this?

### As someone who is into [*vexillology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology), I like checking my knowledge of flags on a regular basis. So I made this awesome web-app to practice my flag knowledge. 


## Where did I get flags from ?

### I used flag images from [FlagPedia CDN](https://flagpedia.net/download/api). 


## Tech used

### I used `HTML`, `TailwindCSS`, and `JavaScript` to built this, and deployed it with `Vercel`
